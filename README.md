# ShellE: The AI-Powered Interactive Shell Experience

ShellE is an interactive shell experience powered by generative AI, featuring a user interface that is entirely AI-generated. Similar to a wiki, it organizes everything into pages, but with a twist: these pages are self-modifying and can transform into anything. Each page includes a chat panel and a content viewer. Entering a command into the chat panel prompts the configured Large Language Model (LLM) to completely rewrite the current page. The page can morph into anythingâ€”from providing answers to questions to becoming a tool that assists you with complex tasks.

ShellE has access to tools in the form of APIs and scripts. Built-in APIs enable ShellE to read and write objects to local storage or make additional generative AI calls. Scripts are user-defined extensions that allow ShellE to perform local actions on your machine. You can add scripts that let ShellE start a build, make a Git commit, or run a cURL command.
